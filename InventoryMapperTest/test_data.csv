Reviews:    * If you need a compact crossover SUV that sips fuel, yet can still tackle the toughest winter weather with ease, consider the 2014 Nissan Juke. It's not as commonplace as a Subaru XV Crosstrek, and its affordable audio and navigation options are some of the best in the segment. Source: KBB.com   * Lively performance; sporty handling; available all-wheel drive. Source: Edmunds   * The JUKE isn't just a crossover - it's a Sport Cross. With its 370Z-inspired taillights, a fiercely sculpted hood, and those aggressive muscular lines, it's anything but ordinary. With the look of a 2-door sports car and the function of a 4-door, JUKE is the best of both worlds. The JUKE also features Rally-inspired headlights and integrated turn signal design, as well as raised ground clearance. Non-traditional placement of the rear door handles high up in the doorframe creates the look of a two-door coupe, adding to the sporty feel of your JUKE. The interior features sport bucket seats that fit close to your body and keep you in control when making tight maneuvers. An available Bluetooth Hands-free Phone System answers your compatible cell phone even if it's buried in a bag or the trunk. The 1.6L Direct Injection Gasoline (DIG) turbo engine, standard in the Nissan JUKE, puts heightened turbocharged performance at your command. The JUKE's front-wheel drive system responds to your every command, providing a reduced curb weight, nimble handling and excellent traction to the front wheels. The JUKE also offers an all-wheel drive option featuring Torque vectoring with rear multilink independent suspension. Meaning that any change in direction, such as navigating a roundabout, can be performed smoothly, securely, and with agility. Using electric power steering instead of hydraulic power steering cuts down on the amount of power needed from the engine. And that means more miles out of every tank. Six standard air bags wrap you in safety. Those who seek pure performance should opt for the NISMO trim for a bump in horsepower as well as lowered suspension. Other features to the NISMO trim include a sportier appearance including a redesigned profile, 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and rear spoiler. Inside you'll enjoy the sport bucket front seats and leather wrapped wheel and shift knob as well.

Kelley Blue Book is a registered trademark of Kelley Blue Book Co., Inc.*Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.Reviews:* The TLX is the definition of smart luxury if you value the driving experience and appreciate Acura's cutting edge technologies like 4-wheel steering or Super Handling All-Wheel Drive over the prestige bestowed by having a European badge on your car's nose. Source: KBB.com* Quiet interior; good fuel economy ratings; sporty handling, particularly with all-wheel drive; plenty of features for the money. Source: Edmunds* Introducing the all new 2015 Acura TLX. The TLX has been shaped and trimmed to reduce drag, lift, turbulence, and rolling resistance. Weight has been reduced by using lighter tougher metals such as aluminum and ultra high strength steel. The 8-Speed 2.4L engine with 206hp with 182 lb-ft of torque has a Dual Clutch Transmission making upshifts and downshifts swift and seamless. Also available is a 9-Speed 3.5L V6 with 290hp and 267 lb-ft of torque featuring Variable Cylinder Management which lets the engine transition to three cylinders at cruising speeds enhancing fuel efficiency. Standard Precision All-Wheel Steer delivers unprecedented handling and is the first system that enables the rear wheels to adjust toe angles independently. Super Handling All-Wheel Drive is also available to direct engine power to match weight distribution. 10 stunning Jewel Eye LED headlights appear like gems in a jeweler's case and light up the night. The beauty continues inside with lit analog gauges and the On Demand Multi-Use Display touchscreen which controls audio and climate functions. The Audio System with a 15GB HDD media storage and 7 speakers allows functionality with multiple sources including USB, CD, Sirius XM, and Pandora. Also available is a 10 speaker premium system by ELS Studio. The Acura Navigation System uses hard drive data for ultra-fast response on the 8-inch screen and can display menus, maps and directions along with additional features such as Zagat restaurant reviews and real-time traffic. Acoustic noise-dampening foam introduced into the unibody provides vault-like silence. Available safety features include lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, blind spot warnings, and parking sensors.
